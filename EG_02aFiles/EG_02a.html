    <h2>Company Founders</h2>
    <p>
        Award-winning professional training QA Ltd was formed in 1985 by three former Intel employees: 
        <ul>
            <li>Mike Cheeseman,</li>
            <li>Jim Watt</li>
            <li>Howard Kornstein.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Company Origins</h2>
    <p>
        The name was inspired by a combination of Queen Anne House in Cirencester, the company's <u>first</u>offices, and the term 'quality assurance'.
        <br/>
        The trio soon moved into the Cirencester Park Estate, where the Earl Bathurst was their landlord.
